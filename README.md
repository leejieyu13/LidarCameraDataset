# LidarCameraDataset

This is a dataset of LiDAR and image data captured at the University of Notre Dame with different environments, a non-cluttered area, a cluttered area and a long corridor.

## LiDAR
The liDAR data is captured by a Slamtec's laser range scanner "RPLIDAR A3", where the first column is angle in degree and the second conlumn is range in mm.
The LiDAR poses are estimated by ICP algorithm. 

## Images
The images are captured by a camera with intrinsic matrix =
[1064.2, -4.0,  982.2;
  0,    1066.2, 519.8;
  0,       0,      1]

## Ground truth
The semantic segmentation ground truth is generated by manually labeling the planes for all pixels (i.e. the walls and the ground plane) without the ceiling.
The floor-plan ground truth is defined by a set of manually measured line segments, which is NOT in the same coordinate system of the LiDAR location.
